# DATA53322--Homework-2


This repository contains the R code, outputs, and presentation materials for Practical Homework 2 of DATA 5322 (Statistical Learning). 
The project aims to predict the presence of diseases baded on demographics and habits. We investigated the relationship between variables and health conditions with 3 model types, including:

- **Linear**
- **Radial Kernel**
- **Polynomial Kernel**

## Contents
- Practical Homework 2 - Support Vector Machines.Rmd: Full code and model implementation using linear, radial, and polynomial kernels.
- Practical Homework 2 - Support Vector Machines.html: n HTML version of the notebook allows the grader to visualize the code without the need to run it.
- PosterPresentation_HW2_MarkDaza_Updates.pdf: Final poster describing work and results. The poster has now been updated to reflect the inclusion of additional performance metrics like precision, recall and F1 score. Conclusion section has been updated to include real-world implications.
